# Turtulrbot_robot_contests
Group project for course "Mechatronics Systems: Design and Integration", which consists three contests:

## Environment:
- Ubuntu  16.04 LTS
- ROS Kinetic Kame

## Contest1:
Implemented path planning algorithms to have Turtlebot robot navigate through the unknown environment and create 2D map for the surrounding environment
## Contest2:
Implemented path planning algorithm to have Turtlebot robot navigate to specific given coordinates and capture images and use OpenCV library to identify captured images
## Contest3:
Collected data from sensors and develop algorithms to achieve human-robot interaction
